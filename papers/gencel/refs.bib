	abstract = {Biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) class IV drugs (low-solubility low-permeability) are generally poor drug candidates, yet, {\textasciitilde}5\% of oral drugs on the market belong to this class. While solubility is often predictable, intestinal permeability is rather complicated and highly dependent on many biochemical/physiological parameters. In this work, we investigated the solubility/permeability of BCS class IV drug, furosemide, considering the complexity of the entire small intestine (SI). Furosemide solubility, physicochemical properties, and intestinal permeability were thoroughly investigated in-vitro and in-vivo throughout the SI. In addition, advanced in-silico simulations (GastroPlus®) were used to elucidate furosemide regional-dependent absorption pattern. Metoprolol was used as the low/high permeability class boundary. Furosemide was found to be a low-solubility compound. Log D of furosemide at the three pH values 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5 (representing the conditions throughout the SI) showed a downward trend. Similarly, segmental-dependent in-vivo intestinal permeability was revealed; as the intestinal region becomes progressively distal, and the pH gradually increases, the permeability of furosemide significantly decreased. The opposite trend was evident for metoprolol. Theoretical physicochemical analysis based on ionization, pKa, and partitioning predicted the same trend and confirmed the experimental results. Computational simulations clearly showed the effect of furosemide’s regional-dependent permeability on its absorption, as well as the critical role of the drug’s absorption window on the overall bioavailability. The data reveals the absorption window of furosemide in the proximal SI, allowing adequate absorption and consequent effect, despite its class IV characteristics. Nevertheless, this absorption window so early on in the SI rules out the suitability of controlled-release furosemide formulations, as confirmed by the in-silico results. The potential link between segmental-dependent intestinal permeability and adequate oral absorption of BCS Class IV drugs may aid to develop challenging drugs as successful oral products.},

	abstract = {Background:
              Following the example of L-valine prodrugs of antiviral nucleoside analogues, L-valine ester of cyclopropavir (valcyclopropavir) was synthesized.
            
            
              Methods:
              The known tetrahydropyranylcyclopropavir was transformed to N-( tert-butoxycarbonyl)-L-valine ester, which was deprotected to valcyclopropavir.
            
            
              Results:
              Stability of valcyclopropavir towards hydrolysis at pH 7.0 roughly corresponded to that of valganciclovir. Valcyclopropavir inhibited replication of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV, Towne and AD169 strains) to approximately the same extent as the parent drug cyclopropavir. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice established that the oral bioavailability of valcyclopropavir was 95\%.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              The prodrug valcyclopropavir offers some improved therapeutic parameters over the parent compound cyclopropavir.},

            WebMO is a web‐based interface for all major quantum chemistry programs. WebMO uses a server–client architecture that installs on a single server or cluster computer and provides access to state‐of‐the‐art computational chemistry programs from a standard web browser. The web interface provides a 3‐D molecular editor, pre‐defined calculations types, job submission and monitoring, visualization of results, and user management tools. Barriers to using state‐of‐the‐art computational chemistry in teaching and research are minimized through WebMO's universal accessibility, its intuitive and uniform interface to all programs, no software to install on client computers, and support for multiple users with a single instance. Applications of WebMO throughout the undergraduate curriculum are provided. The extensible open‐architecture design allows for collaboration among educators, researchers, quantum chemistry program developers, and the WebMO interface developers.

              The uptake and elimination of beta-lactam antibiotics in the human body are facilitated by the proton-coupled peptide transporters PepT1 (SLC15A1) and PepT2 (SLC15A2). The mechanism by which SLC15 family transporters recognize and discriminate between different drug classes and dietary peptides remains unclear, hampering efforts to improve antibiotic pharmacokinetics through targeted drug design and delivery. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the proton-coupled peptide transporter, PepT2 from
              Rattus norvegicus
              , in complex with the widely used beta-lactam antibiotics cefadroxil, amoxicillin and cloxacillin. Our structures, combined with pharmacophore mapping, molecular dynamics simulations and biochemical assays, establish the mechanism of beta-lactam antibiotic recognition and the important role of protonation in drug binding and transport.},
