  title: Modeling Shifts in Reversible Chemical Reactions and Economic Markets
  description: Both the economy and chemical reactions can act as a system in equilibrium. This papers explores this interdisciplinary concept by modeling reversible reactions using both chemical equilibrium and economic models utilizing software such as Gaussian and Mathematica-based modeling.
