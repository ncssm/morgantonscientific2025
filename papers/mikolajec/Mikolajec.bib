              . These ancient peoples' control over the properties of latex and processed rubber gave rise to the Mesoamerican ball game, a central ritual element in all ancient Mesoamerican societies.},

              A mixture of corn starch and glycerol plasticizer (CSG) was blended with latex natural rubber (LNR) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). The addition of 10 phr of CMC improved the Young’s modulus (6.7 MPa), tensile strength (8 MPa), and elongation at break (80\%) of the CSG/LNR blend. The morphology of the CSG/LNR/CMC blends showed a uniform distribution of LNR particles (1–3 µm) in the CSG matrix. The addition of CMC enhanced the swelling ability and water droplet contact angle of the blends owing to the swelling properties, interfacial crosslinking, and amphiphilic structure of CMC. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the reaction between the C=C bond of LNR and the carboxyl groups (–COO
              −
              ) of CMC, in which the Na
              +
              ions in CMC acted as a catalyst. Notably, the mechanical properties of the CSG/LNR/CMC blend were improved owing to the miscibility of CSG/CMC and the CMC/LNR interfacial reaction. The CSG/LNR/CMC biodegradable polymer with high mechanical properties and interfacial tension can be used for packaging, agriculture, and medical applications.},

	abstract = {Young's modulus (or the Young modulus) is a mechanical property of solid materials that measures the tensile or compressive stiffness when the force is applied lengthwise. It is the modulus of elasticity for tension or axial compression. Young's modulus is defined as the ratio of the stress (force per unit area) applied to the object and the resulting axial strain (displacement or deformation) in the linear elastic region of the material.
Although Young's modulus is named after the 19th-century British scientist Thomas Young, the concept was developed in 1727 by Leonhard Euler. The first experiments that used the concept of Young's modulus in its modern form were performed by the Italian scientist Giordano Riccati in 1782, pre-dating Young's work by 25 years.  The term modulus is derived from the Latin root term modus, which means measure.},

	abstract = {Poly(lactic acid) (PLA), derived from renewable resources, plays a significant role in the global biodegradable plastic market. However, its widespread adoption faces challenges, including high brittleness, hydrophobicity, limited biodegradability, and higher costs compared to traditional petroleum-based plastics. This study addresses these challenges by incorporating thermoplastic pineapple stem starch (TPSS) and modified natural rubber (MNR) into PLA blends. TPSS, derived from pineapple stem waste, is employed to enhance hydrophilicity, biodegradability, and reduce costs. While the addition of TPSS (10 to 40 wt.\%) marginally lowered mechanical properties due to poor interfacial interaction with PLA, the inclusion of MNR (1 to 10 wt.\%) in the PLA/20TPSS blend significantly improved stretchability and impact strength, resulting in suitable modulus (1.3 to 1.7 GPa) and mechanical strength (32 to 52 MPa) for diverse applications. The presence of 7 wt.\% MNR increased impact strength by 90\% compared to neat PLA. The ternary blend exhibited a heterogeneous morphology with enhanced interfacial adhesion, confirmed by microfibrils and a rough texture on the fracture surface. Additionally, a downward shift in PLA’s glass transition temperature (Tg) by 5–6 °C indicated improved compatibility between components. Remarkably, the PLA ternary blends demonstrated superior water resistance and proper biodegradability compared to binary blends. These findings highlight the potential of bio-based plastics, such as PLA blends with TPSS and MNR, to contribute to sustainable economic models and reduce environmental impact for using in plastic packaging applications.},
