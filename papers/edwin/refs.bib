	abstract = {The knowledge of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has progressively deepened during the last forty years. Research activities and clinical studies have been remarkably fruitful in novel findings elucidating multiple aspects of the pathogenesis of the disease, improving CLL diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Whereas the diagnostic criteria for CLL have not substantially changed over time, prognostication has experienced an expansion with the identification of new biological and genetic biomarkers. Thanks to next-generation sequencing (NGS), an unprecedented number of gene mutations were identified with potential prognostic and predictive value in the 2010s, although significant work on their validation is still required before they can be used in a routine clinical setting. In terms of treatment, there has been an impressive explosion of new approaches based on targeted therapies for CLL patients during the last decade. In this current chemotherapy-free era, BCR and BCL2 inhibitors have changed the management of CLL patients and clearly improved their prognosis and quality of life. In this review, we provide an overview of these novel advances, as well as point out questions that should be further addressed to continue improving the outcomes of patients.},

	abstract = {Background
              The last decade witnessed the emergence of several therapeutic options for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) for first-line and relapsed settings. The vast majority of patients with relapsed or refractory CLL carry poor prognostic features, which are strong predictors of shorter overall survival and resistance to first-line treatment, particularly fludarabine-based regimens.
            
            
              Methods
              This article highlights the current role of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and active immunotherapy as treatment options for this select group. The rationale of using IMiDs is discussed from the perspective of lenalidomide as a novel active agent. Relevant clinical trials using IMiDs alone or in combinations are discussed. New immunotherapeutic experimental approaches are also described.
            
            
              Results
              As a single agent, lenalidomide offers an overall response rate of 32\% to 47\% in patients with relapsed/refractory disease. Recent studies have shown promising activity as a single agent in treatment-naive patients. The combination of lenalidomide with immunotherapy (rituximab and ofatumumab) has also shown clinical responses. Encouraging preclinical and early clinical data have been observed with different immunotherapeutic approaches.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The use of IMiDs alone or in combination with immunotherapy represents a treatment option for relapsed/refractory or treatment-naive patients. Mature data and further studies are needed to validate overall and progression-free survival. The toxicity profile of lenalidomide might limit its use and delay further studies. Immunotherapy offers another potential alternative, but further understanding of the immunogenicity of CLL cells and the mechanisms of tumor flare reaction is needed to improve the outcomes in this field.},

            Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation led to the discovery of the allogeneic GVL effect, which remains the most convincing evidence that immune cells can cure cancer in humans. However, despite its great paradigmatic and clinical relevance, induction of GVL by conventional allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation remains a quite rudimentary form of leukemia immunotherapy. It is toxic and its efficacy is far from optimal. It is therefore sobering that since the discovery of the GVL effect 3 decades ago, the way GVL is induced and manipulated has practically not changed. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that injection of T cells primed against a single Ag present on neoplastic cells could enhance the GVL effect without causing any GVHD. We therefore contend that Ag-targeted adoptive T-cell immunotherapy represents the future of leukemia immunotherapy, and we discuss the specific strategies that ought to be evaluated to reach this goal. Differences between these strategies hinge on 2 key elements: the nature of the target Ag and the type of Ag receptor expressed on T cells.},

The important improvement in the treatment of CLL can be ascribed to the availability of many new options, mainly with the development of novel targeted therapies, such as ibrutinib, idelalisib, duvelisib and venetoclax. There are now newer tests that reliably define high‐risk patients, and treatment plans can be tailored accordingly. Overall, this indeed is a new era in the treatment of patients with CLL. However, despite this progress, CLL remains an incurable disease and continues to remain challenging. In this brief review, the authors highlight the many great choices available to clinicians who manage patients with CLL and focus on the sequencing of these choices based on the available data.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy with anti–PD-1 antibodies has been associated with mixed outcomes in small cohorts of patients with relapsed aggressive B-cell lymphomas after CAR-T failure. To define CPI therapy efficacy more definitively in this population, we retrospectively evaluated clinical outcomes in a large cohort of 96 patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas receiving CPI therapy after CAR-T failure across 15 US academic centers. Most patients (53\%) had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, were treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel (53\%), relapsed early (≤180 days) after CAR-T (83\%), and received pembrolizumab (49\%) or nivolumab (43\%). CPI therapy was associated with an overall response rate of 19\% and a complete response rate of 10\%. Median duration of response was 221 days. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 54 and 159 days, respectively. Outcomes to CPI therapy were significantly improved in patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. PFS (128 vs 51 days) and OS (387 vs 131 days) were significantly longer in patients with late (\&gt;180 days) vs early (≤180 days) relapse after CAR-T. Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 19\% of patients treated with CPI. Most patients (83\%) died, commonly because of progressive disease. Only 5\% had durable responses to CPI therapy. In the largest cohort of patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma treated with CPI therapy after CAR-T relapse, our results reveal poor outcomes, particularly among those relapsing early after CAR-T. In conclusion, CPI therapy is not an effective salvage strategy for most patients after CAR-T, where alternative approaches are needed to improve post–CAR-T outcomes.},
