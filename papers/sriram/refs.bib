              Human biomechanical energy is characterized by fluctuating amplitudes and variable low frequency, and an effective utilization of such energy cannot be achieved by classical energy-harvesting technologies. Here we report a high-efficient self-charging power system for sustainable operation of mobile electronics exploiting exclusively human biomechanical energy, which consists of a high-output triboelectric nanogenerator, a power management circuit to convert the random a.c. energy to d.c. electricity at 60\% efficiency, and an energy storage device. With palm tapping as the only energy source, this power unit provides a continuous d.c. electricity of 1.044 mW (7.34 W m
              −3
              ) in a regulated and managed manner. This self-charging unit can be universally applied as a standard ‘infinite-lifetime’ power source for continuously driving numerous conventional electronics, such as thermometers, electrocardiograph system, pedometers, wearable watches, scientific calculators and wireless radio-frequency communication system, which indicates the immediate and broad applications in personal sensor systems and internet of things.},

	abstract = {The piezoelectric energy harvesting is a promising, interesting and complex technology. Herein, the aim is to review the key groups of parameters that contribute to the performance of energy harvesting and to offer a guideline for the future development. For this purpose, a universal theoretical model is developed. According to the model, the parameters are divided into six groups. Each group is then discussed. First, a discussion on the piezoelectric materials status, advantages and disadvantages of ceramics, polymers, single crystals, composites, nanomaterials, and lead‐free materials are summarized. The orientation of materials is also discussed. Second, the structure designs, including off‐resonance, on‐resonance, and impact design were introduced. Third, typical sources of excitations and vibrations are given, including direct contact force, low vibration force, hydraulic, pneumatic power, and acoustic power. The fourth consideration is on the effect of frequency and speed is discussed, focusing on the high‐frequency and high‐speed conditions. This is followed by the effect of electrical load on the output power of an energy harvester was discussed. Last, the parameters of energy accumulation effect and methods are also introduced. Following the above discussion, some examples are provided to show the potential applications, including the areas of structural health monitoring, vibration engines, pavement road energy harvesting, wireless sensor nodes, and human gait power. Finally, at the end of the review, the future challenges are addressed.},

            A self-powered system based on energy harvesting technology can be a potential candidate for solving the problem of supplying power to electronic devices. In this review, we focus on portable and wearable self-powered systems, starting with typical energy harvesting technology, and introduce portable and wearable self-powered systems with sensing functions. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of self-powered systems in actuation functions and the development of self-powered systems toward intelligent functions under the support of information processing and artificial intelligence technologies.},

	abstract = {Harvesting mechanical energy from human motion is an attractive approach for obtaining clean and sustainable electric energy to power wearable sensors, which are widely used for health monitoring, activity recognition, gait analysis and so on. This paper studies a piezoelectric energy harvester for the parasitic mechanical energy in shoes originated from human motion. The harvester is based on a specially designed sandwich structure with a thin thickness, which makes it readily compatible with a shoe. Besides, consideration is given to both high performance and excellent durability. The harvester provides an average output power of 1 mW during a walk at a frequency of roughly 1 Hz. Furthermore, a direct current (DC) power supply is built through integrating the harvester with a power management circuit. The DC power supply is tested by driving a simulated wireless transmitter, which can be activated once every 2–3 steps with an active period lasting 5 ms and a mean power of 50 mW. This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying piezoelectric energy harvesters to power wearable sensors.},
