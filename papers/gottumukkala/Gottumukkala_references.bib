            Due to the high prevalence of diabetes mellitus, researchers have conducted numerous experimental animal studies. However, the mammalian diabetes model is cumbersome and expensive to operate, while the cheap and simple common silkworm diabetes model has the disadvantage of a short cycle time. Since the growth of silkworms is greatly affected by environmental factors, we extended the five‐age cycle of silkworms by lowering the ambient temperature to establish a novel low‐temperature silkworm diabetes model. Our goal was to determine whether the low‐temperature feeding of a high‐sugar diet to silkworms could serve as an effective animal model for diabetes. Also, we aimed to resolve certain issues concerning the normal temperature silkworm diabetes model, such as the short time frame for experiments and erratic fluctuations in blood sugar levels. Silkworms weighing between 0.9 and 1.0 g at the beginning of the fifth instar were selected, and we created diabetic silkworms by feeding mulberry leaves containing 4\% glucose daily in a 16–20°C environment. When the silkworms were kept at a cooler temperature, the fifth instar stage lasted for an additional 9–11 days. In the model group, 83.3\% of the silkworms had blood glucose levels greater than 7.8 mmol/L, while the total prevalence of diabetic silkworms was 89.8\%. Moreover, JNK phosphorylation expression rose in the model group, while PI3K expression fell. Additionally, the JNK and PI3K signaling pathway expressions matched diabetic signals. Therefore, using silkworms to create a diabetes model in a cool environment is a straightforward and cost‐effective approach to studying diabetes in animals.

                  Silkworms reared in a cold environment had a prolonged experimental window in the experiment, with their fifth age extended to 9–11 days.
                
                
                  By reducing the amount of glucose in the food of silkworms, their blood glucose levels stabilized after initial elevation. Furthermore, the effect on silkworm growth was lower.},

              Sucrose is a major sweetener added to various foods and beverages. Excessive intake of sucrose leads to increases in blood glucose levels, which can result in the development and exacerbation of lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity and diabetes. In this study, we established an
              in vivo
              evaluation system using silkworms to explore substances that suppress the increase in blood glucose levels caused by dietary intake of sucrose. Silkworm hemolymph glucose levels rapidly increased after intake of a sucrose-containing diet. Addition of acarbose or voglibose, α-glycosidase inhibitors clinically used for diabetic patients, suppressed the dietary sucrose-induced increase in the silkworm hemolymph glucose levels. Screening performed using the sucrose-induced postprandial hyperglycemic silkworm model allowed us to identify some lactic acid bacteria that inhibit the increase in silkworm hemolymph glucose levels caused by dietary intake of sucrose. The inhibitory effects of the
              Lactococcus lactis
              \#Ll-1 bacterial strain were significantly greater than those of different strains of lactic acid bacteria. No effect of the
              Lactococcus lactis
              \#Ll-1 strain was observed in silkworms fed a glucose diet. These results suggest that the sucrose diet-induced postprandial hyperglycemic silkworm is a useful model for evaluating chemicals and lactic acid bacteria that suppress increases in blood glucose levels.},

	abstract = {Greek yogurt is a strained yogurt with a high protein content that brings nutritional benefits. To enhance the functional benefits of Greek yogurt, Greek yogurt was prepared with various combinations of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus gasseri BNR17, and Lactobacillus plantarum HY7714). Effects of probiotic LAB on quality, sensory, and microbiological characteristics of Greek yogurt were then compared. Among samples, Greek yogurt fermented by S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus showed the highest changes of pH and titratable acidity during 21 d of storage at 4 °C. Greek yogurt fermented with L. plantarum HY7714 had a higher viscosity than other samples. Greek yogurt fermented with S. thermophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. gasseri BNR17, and L. plantarum HY7714 showed superior physicochemical properties and received the highest preference score from sensory evaluation among samples. Overall, the population of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) was more effectively reduced in Greek yogurt fermented with probiotic LAB than in commercial Greek yogurt during storage at 4, 10, and 25 °C. Thus, the addition of L. gasseri BNR17 and L. plantarum HY7714 as starter cultures could enhance the microbial safety of Greek yogurt and sensory acceptance by consumers.},
