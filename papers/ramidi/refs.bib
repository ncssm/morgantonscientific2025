	abstract = {The ability of renewable resources to provide energy has a very great potential. It can provide sustainability for the needs of the future, especially now that fossil fuel sources are gradually diminishing. Although renewable energy is very promising, it is still not yet fully integrated in teaching in schools. There are many renewable sources but almost all of it is dependent on solar energy and to increase awareness and knowledge of its potential, this study aims to provide a training module focusing on the renewable energy of the sun. The training module will be able to show how energy conversion works. Also, the training module uses developing innovations for harnessing solar energy to increase its efficiency. Because it will be used as a laboratory equipment, testing for efficiency and transportability were conducted. With planning, testing, and evaluation the researchers were able to develop a training module that is efficient with 0.15 percent - 7.40 percent coefficient of variance out of thirty (30) trials, and at the same time transportable and inexpensive that is ideal for the goal of this research to implement the teaching of renewable energy to schools.},
