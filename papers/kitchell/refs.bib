            Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is used in textile and packaging industries. The main source of PET production is fossil fuels with limited capacity. Also, PET products are single use that transform into high volumes of wastes, causing ecosystem problems. Recycling is proposed to confront this challenge. The four major PET recycling techniques are mechanical, chemical, pyrolysis, and enzymatic. Mechanical, pyrolysis, and enzymatic techniques have constrained capabilities to manage PET waste. Chemical recycling is the potential path to expanding recycling PET waste with possibility of upcycling and addressing dirty waste streams. Several chemical methods are introduced and discussed in literature. The five major chemical recycling techniques are glycolysis, alcoholysis, aminolysis, ammonolysis, and hydrolysis. This review describes PET depolymerization via these techniques and introduces hydrolysis as the one that can depolymerize PET in an organic‐free solvent environment. Hydrolysis tolerates PET mixed wastes streams including copolymers. It helps avoid challenges attributed to using organic solvents in reaction systems. Moreover, hydrolysis produces terephthalic acid, PET monomer, which has recently gained attention as the initiative monomer for PET production. The review focuses on three forms of hydrolysis—alkaline, neutral, and acid, by presenting background studies, issued patents, and recent trends on application of hydrolysis.},

	abstract = {Chemical recycling of textiles holds the potential to yield materials of equal quality and value as products from virgin feedstock. Selective depolymerization of textile polyester (PET) from regenerated cellulose/PET blends, by means of alkaline hydrolysis, renders the monomers of PET while cellulose remains in fiber form. Here, we present the mechanism and reactivity of textile PET during alkaline hydrolysis. Part I of this article series focuses on the cellulose part and a possible industrialization of such a process. The kinetics and reaction mechanism for alkaline hydrolysis of polyester packaging materials or virgin bulk polyester are well described in the scientific literature; however, information on depolymerization of PET from textiles is sparse. We find that the reaction rate of hydrolysis is not affected by disintegrating the fabric to increase its surface area. We ascribe this to the yarn structure, where texturing and a low density assures a high accessibility even without disintegration. The reaction, similar to bulk polyester, is shown to be surface specific and proceeds via endwise peeling. Finally, we show that the reaction product terephthalic acid is pure and obtained in high yields.},

	abstract = {Disposal of plastic waste has become a widely discussed issue, due to the potential environmental impact of improper waste disposal. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) packaging accounted for 44.7\% of single-serve beverage packaging in the US in 2021, and 12\% of global solid waste. A strategic solution is needed to manage plastic packaging solid waste. Major beverage manufacturers have pledged to reduce their environmental footprint by taking steps towards a sustainable future. The PET bottle has several properties that make it an environmentally friendly choice. The PET bottle has good barrier properties as its single-layer, mono-material composition allows it to be more easily recycled. Compared to glass, the PET bottle is lightweight and has a lower carbon footprint in production and transportation. With modern advancements to decontamination processes in the recycling of post-consumer recycled PET (rPET or PCR), it has become a safe material for reuse as beverage packaging. It has been 30 years since the FDA first began certifying PCR PET production processes as compliant for production of food contact PCR PET, for application within the United States. This article provides an overview of PET bottle-to-bottle recycling and guidance for beverage manufacturers looking to advance goals for sustainability.},

	abstract = {The recovery and recycling of textile waste is becoming urgent since textiles are generating more and more waste. In one year, about 92 million tons of textile waste are produced and the fashion industry accounts for 58 million tons of plastic waste per year. Several different synthetic fibres are used in textiles, thanks to their excellent processability and mechanical properties, but on the other hand, the difficulties linked to their end of life and the release of microplastics from them during washing is currently a cause of great concern. In this context, policy actions have been aimed at promoting recycling of waste and replacing fossil-based fibres with biobased fibres. The current review, considering both scientific papers published on international journals and web sources, considers the sorting of textiles and the possible recycling of polyesters, polyamides and acrylics. Nevertheless, the contamination and presence of mixed fibres in fabrics is another issue to face for recycling. Methodologies to solve the issue linked to the presence of elastane, present in the stretch fabrics, as well as the possibility of recycling textiles in the non-woven and composite sector are investigated. Moreover, chemical recycling and enzymatic recycling of fossil polymers are also considered. Thanks to the comprehensive scheme of this review, it is possible to deduce that, while the use of biobased materials should rapidly increase in textile applications, the perspective of recycling materials obtained from waste textile into durable and/or high-performance products seems the most promising.},

              The textile industry is ever-growing but only a few recycling options exist for waste fabrics to keep end-of-use clothing articles within the value chain. Generally, these include fibre-to-fibre strategies for pure textiles such as cotton or polyester. However, most textiles comprise blends of fibres which encumbers both mechanical and chemical recycling processes. For example, the polymer elastane is added to increase stretchability in many textiles, whereas polyurethane coatings and membranes partly make up rain clothes, bags and artificial leather items. Here we report the selective disassembly of these two polymers into base chemicals adapting a solvolysis process with
              tert
              -amyl alcohol. We showcase the successful depolymerisation of elastane recovered from the dissolution of fabric blends, and also the direct disassembly of elastane containing- or PU-coated textiles with polyamide fabrics. This work opens up new opportunities for the recycling of certain blended textiles.},
