            Drug discovery aims to identify potential therapeutic compounds capable of modulating the activity of specific biological targets. Molecular docking can efficiently support this process by predicting binding interactions between small molecules and macromolecular targets and potentially accelerating screening campaigns. SwissDock is a computational tool released in 2011 as part of the SwissDrugDesign project, providing a free web-based service for small-molecule docking after automatized preparation of ligands and targets. Here, we present the latest version of SwissDock, in which EADock DSS has been replaced by two state-of-the-art docking programs, i.e. Attracting Cavities and AutoDock Vina. AutoDock Vina provides faster docking predictions, while Attracting Cavities offers more accurate results. Ligands can be imported in various ways, including as files, SMILES notation or molecular sketches. Targets can be imported as PDB files or identified by their PDB ID. In addition, advanced search options are available both for ligands and targets, giving users automatized access to widely-used databases. The web interface has been completely redesigned for interactive submission and analysis of docking results. Moreover, we developed a user-friendly command-line access which, in addition to all options of the web site, also enables covalent ligand docking with Attracting Cavities. The new version of SwissDock is freely available at https://www.swissdock.ch/.},

	abstract = {Ubiquitously expressed seven-transmembrane receptors (7TMRs) classically signal through heterotrimeric G proteins and are commonly referred to as G protein-coupled receptors. It is now recognized that 7TMRs also signal through β-arrestins, which act as versatile adapters controlling receptor signaling, desensitization, and trafficking. Most endogenous receptors appear to signal in a balanced fashion using both β-arrestin and G protein-mediated pathways. Some 7TMRs are thought to be nonsignaling “decoys” because of their inability to activate typical G protein signaling pathways; it has been proposed that these receptors act to scavenge ligands or function as coreceptors. Here we demonstrate that ligand binding to the decoy receptor CXCR7 does not result in activation of signaling pathways typical of G proteins but does activate MAP kinases through β-arrestins in transiently transfected cells. Furthermore, we observe that vascular smooth muscle cells that endogenously express CXCR7 migrate to its ligand interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant (ITAC), an effect that is significantly attenuated by treatment with either a CXCR7 antagonist or β-arrestin depletion by siRNA. This example of an endogenous “β-arrestin-biased” 7TMR that signals through β-arrestin in the absence of G protein activation demonstrates that some 7TMRs encoded in the genome have evolved to signal through β-arrestin exclusively and suggests that other receptors that are currently thought to be orphans or decoys may also signal through such nonclassical pathways.},
