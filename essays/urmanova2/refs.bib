	abstract = {Background:
              Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a life-threatening illness with poor treatment outcomes. Although transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising non-invasive brain stimulation method, its effect in patients with AN remains unclear.
            
            
              Objective:
              This study investigated changes in maladaptive eating behavior, body mass index (BMI), and depression after 10 sessions of anodal tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).
            
            
              Methods:
              In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 43 inpatients with AN were divided to receive either active (
              n
              = 22) or sham (
              n
              = 21) tDCS over the left DLPFC (anode F3/cathode Fp2, 2 mA for 30 min). All patients filled the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZUNG), and their BMI was measured. These values were obtained repeatedly in four stages: (1) before tDCS treatment, (2) after tDCS treatment, (3) in the follow-up after 2 weeks, and (4) in the follow-up after 4 weeks.
            
            
              Results:
              Primary outcomes (EDE-Q) based on the ANOVA results do not show any between-group differences either after the active part of the study or in the follow-up. Secondary analysis reveals a reduction in some items of EDE-Q. Compared with sham tDCS, active tDCS significantly improved self-evaluation based on body shape (
              p
              \&lt; 0.05) and significantly decreased the need of excessive control over calorie intake (
              p
              \&lt; 0.05) in the 4-week follow-up. However, the results do not survive multiple comparison correction. In both sham and active groups, the BMI values improved, albeit not significantly.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              We did not observe a significant effect of tDCS over the left DLPFC on complex psychopathology and weight recovery in patients with AN. tDCS reduced the need to follow specific dietary rules and improved body image evaluation in patients with AN. Tests with a larger sample and different positions of electrodes are needed.

              Introduction
              Two methods of non-invasive brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have demonstrable positive effects on cognition and can ameliorate neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression. Less is known about the efficacy of these approaches in common neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we evaluate the effects of TMS and tDCS upon cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in the major dementias, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson’s disease with dementia (PDD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), as well as the potential pre-dementia states of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Parkinson’s disease (PD).
            
            
              Methods
              PubMed (until 7 February 2014) and PsycINFO (from 1967 to January Week 3 2014) databases were searched in a semi-systematic manner in order to identify relevant treatment studies. A total of 762 studies were identified and 32 studies (18 in the dementias and 14 in PD populations) were included.
            
            
              Results
              No studies were identified in patients with PDD, FTD or VaD. Of the dementias, 13 studies were conducted in patients with AD, one in DLB, and four in MCI. A total of 16 of the 18 studies showed improvements in at least one cognitive or neuropsychiatric outcome measure. Cognitive or neuropsychiatric improvements were observed in 12 of the 14 studies conducted in patients with PD.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Both TMS and tDCS may have potential as interventions for the treatment of symptoms associated with dementia and PD. These results are promising; however, available data were limited, particularly within VaD, PDD and FTD, and major challenges exist in order to maximise the efficacy and clinical utility of both techniques. In particular, stimulation parameters vary considerably between studies and are likely to subsequently impact upon treatment efficacy.},

New treatments that have been suggested involve targeted, brain-directed interventions such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We describe findings from seven individuals with treatment-resistant AN who received 10 sessions of anodal tDCS, over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Material and method: In this open-label, single-arm study, seven patients received anodal tDCS (2mA) for 25 minutes over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex daily for ten days. Assessments pre-tDCS, post-tDCS and one month later included the Eating Attitude Test (EAT), Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results: Three patients improved in all three rating scales immediately after the treatment sessions and one month later. Two patients showed improvement at the end of treatment but returned to the baseline after one month. One subject improved only on the BDI scale but not eating scales. The scores in the three rating scales were unaffected by treatment in the remaining patient. There was a significant effect of time (pre, post and 1 month later) on the three rating scores; BDI (P = 0.016), EDI (P = 0.018) and EAT (P = 0.016) and a significant correlation between the percent improvement of BDI and EAT (p = 0.01), and between BDI and EDI (P = 0.006). Conclusions: These findings suggest that tDCS has potential as an adjuvant treatment for AN and deserves further study.},

            Ethical dilemmas frequently arise in the treatment of clients with eating disorders, and clinicians regularly encounter an array of ethical challenges related to whether or not overt and covert coercive tactics should be implemented. In this paper, the authors provide an overview of perplexing ethical questions relevant to medical, nutritional and psychological treatment of clients with eating disorders including imposed treatment, enforced feeding, the duty to protect minors and adults, the determination of competence and capacity among medically comprised clients, and the effectiveness of coercive treatment for clients with eating disorders. The processes of ethical decision‐making in terms of ethical principles, professional codes of conduct, the existing empirical literature and the use of a decision‐making framework are explored. Taking a collaborative and client‐sensitive approach, the authors outline and apply an integrative ethical decision‐making model to facilitate clinicians' decision‐making process.

              Background
              Eating disorders (ED) are chronic and sometimes deadly illnesses. Existing treatments have limited proven efficacy, especially in the case of adults with anorexia nervosa (AN). Emerging neural models of ED provide a rationale for more targeted, brain‐directed interventions.
            
            
              Aims
              This systematic review has examined the effects of neuromodulation techniques on eating behaviours and body weight and assessed their potential for therapeutic use in ED.
            
            
              Method
              
                All articles in PubMed, PsychInfo and Web of Knowledge were considered and screened against a
                priori
                inclusion/exclusion criteria. The effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) were examined across studies in ED samples, other psychiatric and neurological disorders, and animal models.
              
            
            
              Results
              Sixty studies were identified. There is evidence for ED symptom reduction following rTMS and DBS in both AN and bulimia nervosa. Findings from studies of other psychiatric and neurological disorders and from animal studies demonstrate that increases in food intake and body weight can be achieved following DBS and that VNS has potential value as a means of controlling eating and inducing weight loss.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Neuromodulation tools have potential for reducing ED symptomatology and related behaviours, and for altering food intake and body weight. In response to such findings, and emerging neural models of ED, treatment approaches are highly unlikely to remain ‘brainless’. More research is required to evaluate the potential of neuromodulation procedures for improving long‐term outcomes in ED. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.},

The authors identified randomized placebo‐controlled trials testing pharmacotherapy‐only treatments and controlled trials testing pharmacotherapy with psychotherapy treatments. Meta‐analysis was performed on placebo‐controlled trials with data for attrition, remission, and weight loss. Qualitative review was performed on remaining controlled treatment literature. A total of 33 studies were considered of which 14 studies with a total of 1,279 patients were included in the meta‐analysis of pharmacotherapy‐only treatment and 8 studies with a total of 683 patients were included in the qualitative review of pharmacotherapy combined with psychotherapy interventions. No evidence suggested significant differences between medication and placebo for attrition. Evidence suggested that pharmacological treatments have a clinically significant advantage over placebo for achieving short‐term remission from binge eating (48.7\% vs. 28.5\%) and for weight loss, although weight losses are not substantial. No data exist to allow evaluation of longer‐term effects of pharmacotherapy‐only treatment for BED. Combining medications with psychotherapy interventions failed to significantly enhance binge outcomes, although specific medications (orlistat, topiramate) enhanced weight losses achieved with cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral weight loss. In summary, BED patients can be advised that certain pharmacotherapies may enhance likelihood of stopping binge eating short term, but that longer‐term effects are unknown. Although some weight loss may occur, it is unlikely to be substantial with available medications. Combining medications with cognitive or behavioral treatments is unlikely to enhance binge outcomes, but specific medications (orlistat, topiramate) may enhance weight losses, albeit modestly.},

              Background
              Psychotherapy is considered central to the effective treatment of eating disorders—focusing on behavioural, psychological, and social factors that contribute to the illness. Research indicates psychotherapeutic interventions out-perform placebo, waitlist, and/or other treatments; but, outcomes vary with room for major improvement. Thus, this review aims to (1) establish and consolidate knowledge on efficacious eating disorder psychotherapies; (2) highlight select emerging psychotherapeutic interventions; and (3) identify knowledge gaps to better inform future treatment research and development.
            
            
              Methods
              The current review forms part of a series of Rapid Reviews published in a special issue in the Journal of Eating Disorders to inform the development of the Australian-government-funded National Eating Disorder Research and Translation Strategy 2021–2031. Three databases were searched for studies published between 2009 and 2023, published in English, and comprising high-level evidence studies (meta-analyses, systematic reviews, moderately sized randomised controlled studies, moderately sized controlled-cohort studies, and population studies). Data pertaining to psychotherapies for eating disorders were synthesised and outlined in the current paper.
            
            
              Results
              281 studies met inclusion criteria. Behavioural therapies were most commonly studied, with cognitive-behavioural and family-based therapies being the most researched; and thus, having the largest evidence-base for treating anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. Other therapies, such as interpersonal and dialectical behaviour therapies also demonstrated positive treatment outcomes. Emerging evidence supports specific use of Acceptance and Commitment; Integrative Cognitive Affective; Exposure; Mindfulness; and Emotionally-Focused therapies; however further research is needed to determine their efficacy. Similarly, growing support for self-help, group, and computer/internet-based therapeutic modalities was noted. Psychotherapies for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder; other, and unspecified feeding and eating disorders were lacking evidence.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Currently, clinical practice is largely supported by research indicating that behavioural and cognitive-behavioural psychotherapies are most effective for the treatment of eating disorders. However, the efficacy of psychotherapeutic interventions varies across studies, highlighting the need for investment and expansion of research into enhanced variants and novel psychotherapies to improve illness outcomes. There is also a pressing need for investigation into the whole range of eating disorder presentations and populations, to determine the most effective interventions.},

              To review the recent literature on the burden of eating disorders in terms of mortality, disability, quality of life, economic cost, and family burden, compared with people without an eating disorder.
            
            
              Recent findings
              Estimates are that yearly over 3.3 million healthy life years worldwide are lost because of eating disorders. In contrast to other mental disorders, in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa years lived with disability (YLDs) have increased. Despite treatment advances, mortality rates of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa remain very high: those who have received inpatient treatment for anorexia nervosa still have a more than five times increased mortality risk. Mortality risks for bulimia nervosa, and for anorexia nervosa treated outside the hospital, are lower but still about twice those of controls. In people with an eating disorder, quality of life is reduced, yearly healthcare costs are 48\% higher than in the general population, the presence of mental health comorbidity is associated with 48\% lower yearly earnings, the number of offspring is reduced, and risks for adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes are increased.
            
            
              Summary
              People with a current or former eating disorder are at risk of increased mortality, high YLD rates, a reduced quality of life, increased costs, and problems with childbearing.},

	abstract = {Eating disorders are a group of psychiatric conditions that involve pathological relationships between patients and food. The most prolific of these disorders are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. The current standard of care involves psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and the management of comorbid conditions, with nutritional rehabilitation reserved for severe cases of anorexia nervosa. Unfortunately, many patients often fail to respond, leaving a concerning treatment gap between the current and requisite treatments for eating disorders. To better understand the neurobiology underlying these eating disorders, investigations have been undertaken to characterize the activity of various neural networks, primarily those activated during tasks of executive inhibition, reward processing, and self-reference. Various neuromodulatory techniques have been proposed to stimulate these networks with the goal of improving patients’ BMI and mental health. The aim of this review is to compile a comprehensive summarization of the current literature regarding the underlying neural connectivity of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder as well as the numerous neuromodulatory modalities that have been investigated. Importantly, we aimed to summarize the most significant clinical trials to date as well as to provide an updated assessment of the role of deep brain stimulation, summarizing numerous recently published clinical studies that have greatly contributed to the literature. In this review, we found therapeutic evidence for transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation in treating individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. We also found significant evidence for the role of deep brain stimulation, particularly as an escalatory therapy option for the those who failed standard therapy. Finally, we hope to provide promising directions for future clinical investigations.},

            Neuromodulation is a clinical tool used for treating chronic neuropathic pain by transmitting controlled physical energy to the pre‐identified neural targets in the central nervous system. Its drug‐free, nonaddictive, and improved targeting characteristics have attracted increasing attention among neuroscience research and clinical practices. This article provides a brief overview of the neuropathic pain and pharmacological routines for treatment, summarizes both the invasive and noninvasive neuromodulation modalities for pain management, and highlights an emerging brain stimulation technology, transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS), with a focus on ultrasound transducer devices and the achieved neuromodulation effects and applications on pain management. Practical considerations of spatial guidance for tFUS are discussed for clinical applications. The safety of transcranial ultrasound neuromodulation and its future prospectives on pain management are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Background
              Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a life-threatening disease with a low effectiveness of treatment. The high relapse and mortality rate indicate new treatment approaches are needed. Here, we represent the protocol for randomized clinical trial (RCT) of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) efficiency in the AN treatment. The main purpose of the 3-week RCT is to determine the effect of tDCS on the mental state and advances in nutritional rehabilitation in patients with AN.
            
            
              Methods
              50 female inpatients (13-25 years old, body mass index (BMI) 17.5 kg/m2 or less) will be randomly allocated into groups: active (n=25) and sham (n=25) tDCS. Thirty 25-minute tDCS sessions (applied current at 2mA) will be given to DLPFC (F3 anode/F4 cathode) twice a day for 3 weeks on working days parallel to treatment as usual. The primary outcome measures include changes in symptoms related to eating disorders, as assessed by the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26), following tDCS sessions over a 3-week trial period. The secondary outcome measures include changes in: brain bioelectric activity, anthropometric measurements, mood, nutritional status, neurocognition, psychological symptoms, selected biological markers related to stress, food intake, inflammation and neurotrophins.
            
            
              Discussion
              This paper describes the evaluation of a 3-week tDCS-based intervention for AN patients. The study design was developed by a multidisciplinary research team to assess the treatment effect, taking into account various types of variables. This approach could help in better understanding the potential therapeutic tDCS strategy in AN.
