# A Note from the Editors

Welcome to the second volume of The Morganton Scientific, NCSSM-Morganton’s research journal. Since last year, the journal has grown—not just in size, but in how we work. More students submitted papers. More editors joined the team. The process became more focused, more collaborative, and more deliberate from start to finish.

As with last year, students from both the Morganton and Online programs contributed research across all areas of STEM. The topics and approaches vary, but each paper is the result of consistent effort and a clear interest in the subject. Every author took their work seriously and saw it through with care.

We are grateful to Mrs. Erika Cummings and Dr. Kathryn Moore for taking the time to speak with our team. Their conversations added valuable perspective to this year’s edition. We also thank Mr. Christopher Collins and Mrs. Jennifer Williams for their steady support throughout the editorial process. This journal would not exist without them.

This volume builds on the foundation laid last year. It reflects the kind of work students at NCSSM are capable of, and we hope it encourages future contributors to keep writing and keep pushing their ideas forward.
